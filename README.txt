DatSlam - Random Slam Generator
A collection of remixes to the Space Jam by Quad City DJ's.

A small JavaScript project I started in 2011 that remains mostly untouched
since then.  I created it for my friend Paul, as we were upset with the lack of
random Space Jam remix generators out there.

This is pretty sloppy and could be cleaned up with Bootstrap if I ever find the
time.  Maybe someday I'll be able to revisit all of these old projects...
